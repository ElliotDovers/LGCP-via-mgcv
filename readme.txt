This directory contains all supplementary materials for the manuscript "Fitting log-Gaussian Cox processes using mgcv"

LGCP via mgcv - Supplementary.pdf contains appendices:
	S1 contains additional simulation settings and results.
	S2 contains a vignette for analysing the gorillas nesting data presented in the manuscript - with code to obtain the freely available dataset.

LGCP via mgcv - Code.zip is directory of all code used for simulations and analyses presented:
	Simulations: this folder contains the R scripts and other files used to run the simulation study.
	Application: this folder contains the R script to analyses the gorillas nesting data

NOTE: Simulations were run in parallel on a High Performance Computing Cluster.
Please run "sim_analysis_iterated.R" for a demonstration of the simulation process and analysis (this has been set to "job=1" for such a demonstration)
